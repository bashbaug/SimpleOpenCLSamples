# Semaphore Emulation

## Layer Purpose

This is a layer that demonstrates how to emulate functionality - in this case, the [cl_khr_semaphore](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_Ext.html#cl_khr_semaphore) extension - using a layer.
It works by intercepting calls to `clGetExtensionFunctionAddressForPlatform` to query function pointers for the `cl_khr_semaphore` extension APIs.
If a query succeeds by default then the layer does nothing and simply returns the queried function pointer as-is.
If the query is unsuccessful however, then the layer returns its own function pointer, which will emulate semaphores using events.

This semaphore emulation layer currently implements v0.9.0 of the `cl_khr_semaphore` extension.
The functionality in this emulation layer is sufficient to run the semaphore samples in this repository.

Please note that the emulated semaphores are intended to be functional, but unlike a native implementation, they may not provide any performance benefit over similar code without using semaphores.

## Layer Requirement

This layer calls `clEnqueueMarkerWithWaitList` and therefore requires OpenCL 1.2.

## Key APIs and Concepts

The most important concepts to understand from this sample are how to intercept `clGetExtensionFunctionAddressForPlatform` to return emulated functions for an extension.

```c
clGetExtensionFunctionAddressForPlatform
clInitLayer
```

## Known Limitations

This section describes some of the limitations of the emulated `cl_khr_semaphore` functionality:

* The layer does not support waiting on a semaphore (blocked by a user event) before signaling the semaphore.
* Many error conditions are not properly checked for and returned.
