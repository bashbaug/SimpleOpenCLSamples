# Layer Samples

This directory contains samples demonstrating installable interception layers.
Layers are a feature supported by newer versions of the [OpenCL ICD Loader](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-ICD-Loader),and may be use to profile, trace, or modify the behavior of an OpenCL implementation at runtime.
For more information, please see the [cl_loader_layers](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-Docs/blob/main/ext/cl_loader_layers.asciidoc) specification.
