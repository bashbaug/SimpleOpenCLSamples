# Julia Set with Vulkan

## Sample Purpose

This is a modified version of the earlier Julia set sample.
Similar to the earlier Julia Set sample, an OpenCL kernel is used to generate a Julia set image.
The main difference between this sample and the earlier sample is that in this sample the Julia set image is used as an Vulkan texture and rendered to the screen instead of writing it to a BMP file.

This sample can create an OpenCL image directly from the Vulkan texture when supported.
In order to share the Vulkan texture with OpenCL, the OpenCL device must support [cl_khr_external_memory](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_Ext.html#cl_khr_external_memory).
Additionally, the Vulkan device must support exporting the Vulkan texture as an OS-specific external memory handle, and the OpenCL device must support importing external memory handles of that type.
Creating the OpenCL image directly from the Vulkan texture avoids a memory copy and can improve performance.

For Windows, the external memory handle types that are currently supported are:

* `CL_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_OPAQUE_WIN32_KHR`

For Linux, the external memory handle types that are currently supported are:

* `CL_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_DMA_BUF_KHR`
* `CL_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_OPAQUE_FD_KHR`

This sample can also share semaphores between Vulkan and OpenCL when supported.
In order to share a Vulkan semaphore with OpenCL, the OpenCL device must support [cl_khr_external_semaphore](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_Ext.html#cl_khr_external_semaphore).
Additionally, the Vulkan device must support exporting the Vulkan semaphore as an OS-specific external semaphore handle, and the OpenCL device must support importing external semaphore handles of that type.
Sharing a semaphore object between Vulkan and OpenCL avoids synchronization on the host and can also improve performance.

For Windows, the external semaphore handle types that are currently supported are:

* `CL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_OPAQUE_WIN32_KHR`

For Linux, the external semaphore handle types that are currently supported are:

* `CL_SEMAPHORE_HANDLE_OPAQUE_FD_KHR`

For more information about these extensions, please see [this blog post](https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-releases-opencl-3.0-extensions-for-neural-network-inferencing-and-opencl-vulkan-interop).
When the extensions are not supported the sample will still run, although perhaps with lower performance.

Important note: The OpenCL extensions used in this sample are very new!
If the sample does not run correctly please ensure you are using the latest OpenCL drivers for your device, or use the command line option to force copying on the host.

## Key APIs and Concepts

This example shows how to share an Vulkan texture and semaphore with OpenCL.

```c
clEnqueueAcquireExternalMemObjectsKHR
clEnqueueReleaseExternalMemObjectsKHR

clCreateSemaphoreWithPropertiesKHR
clEnqueueSignalSemaphoresKHR
clReleaseSemaphoreKHR
```

## Command Line Options

Note: Many of these command line arguments are identical to the earlier Julia set sample.

| Option | Default Value | Description |
|:--|:-:|:--|
| `-d <index>` | 0 | Specify the index of the OpenCL device in the platform to execute on the sample on.
| `-p <index>` | 0 | Specify the index of the OpenCL platform to execute the sample on.
| `--hostcopy` | n/a | Do not use the `cl_khr_external_memory` extension and unconditionally copy on the host.
| `--hostsync` | n/a | Do not use the `cl_khr_external_semaphore` extension and exclusively synchronize on the host.
| `--linear` | n/a | Use linear images (`VK_IMAGE_TILING_LINEAR`).  May be useful for debugging.
| `--nodevicelocal` | n/a | Do not use device local images (`VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_DEVICE_LOCAL_BIT`).  May be useful for debugging.
| `--gwx <number>` | 512 | Specify the global work size to execute, in the X direction.  This also determines the width of the generated image.
| `--gwy <number>` | 512 | Specify the global work size to execute, in the Y direction.  This also determines the height of the generated image.
| `--lwx <number>` | 0 | Specify the local work size in the X direction.  If either local works size dimension is zero a `NULL` local work size is used.
| `--lwy <number>` | 0 | Specify the local work size in the Y direction.  If either local works size dimension is zero a `NULL` local work size is used.
| `--immediate` | n/a | Prefer `VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR` (no vsync).  May result in faster framerates at the cost of visible tearing.
| `--paused` | n/a | Start with the animation paused.

## Controls While Running

| Control | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `Escape` | Exits from the sample.
| `Space` | Toggle animation.
| `A` | Increase the real part of the complex constant `C`.
| `Z` | Decrease the real part of the complex constant `C`.
| `S` | Increase the imaginary part of the complex constant `C`.
| `X` | Decrease the imaginary part of the complex constant `C`.

## How to Generate Vulkan SPIR-V Files

The SPIR-V files for the Vulkan vertex shader and fragment shader were compiled with `glslang`, which is included in the Vulkan SDK.
The command lines used to compile the SPIR-V files were:

```sh
/path/to/glslangvalidator --target-env vulkan1.0 juliavk.vert -o juliavk.vert.spv
/path/to/glslangvalidator --target-env vulkan1.0 juliavk.frag -o juliavk.frag.spv
```
