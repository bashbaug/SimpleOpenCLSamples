# smemhelloworld

## Sample Purpose

This sample demonstrates usage of shared memory allocations.
Other similar samples demonstrate usage of device memory and host memory allocations.

Shared memory allocations share ownership and are intended to implicitly migrate between the host and one or more devices.
Because shared memory allocations may migrate, they may generally be accessed with good performance on both the host and a device, albeit after paying for the cost of migration.
When supported, shared memory is a great way to enable an application to use Unified Shared Memory with very good performance.

The sample initializes a source USM allocation, copies it to a destination USM allocation using a kernel, then checks on the host that the copy was performed correctly.

## Key APIs and Concepts

This sample allocates shared memory using `clSharedMemAllocINTEL` and frees it using `clMemFreeINTEL`.

Since shared memory may be directly accessed and manipulated on the host, this sample does not need to use any special Unified Shared Memory APIs to copy to or from a shared allocation, or to map or unmap a shared allocation.
Instead, this sample simply ensures that copy kernel is complete before verifying that the copy was performed correctly.
For simplicity, this sample ensures all commands in the command queue are complete using `clFinish`, but other completion mechanisms could be used instead that may be more efficient.

Within a kernel, a Unified Shared Memory allocation can be accessed similar to an OpenCL buffer (a `cl_mem`), or a Shared Virtual Memory allocation.
Unified Shared Memory allocations are set as an argument to a kernel using `clSetKernelArgMemPointerINTEL`.

When profiling an application using shared memory allocations, be aware that migrations between the host and the device may be occurring implicitly.
These implicit transfers may cause additional apparent latency when launching a kernel (for transfers to the device) or completion latency (for transfers to the host) versus device memory or host memory allocations.

Since Unified Shared Memory is an OpenCL extension, this sample uses the `libusm` library to query the extension APIs.
Please see the `libusm` [README](../libusm/README.md) for more detail.

This sample currently uses c APIs because the C++ bindings do not support Unified Shared Memory (yet).
When support for Unified Shared Memory is added to the C++ bindings the samples will be updated to use the C++ bindings instead, which should simplify the sample slightly.
