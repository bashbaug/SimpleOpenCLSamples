    "Assuming that this worked correctly, we can now query the installed OpenCL platforms.  An OpenCL platform is an OpenCL implementation for a specific device or collection of devices.  There may be an OpenCL platform from a specific device vendor, a specific class of devices from that vendor, or even a specific device.  For example, if you have a CPU from one vendor and a GPU from another vendor, you may need to install two OpenCL platforms to enumerate both devices.\n",
