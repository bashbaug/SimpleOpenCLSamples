# Julia Set with OpenGL

## Sample Purpose

This is a modified version of the earlier Julia set sample.
Similar to the earlier Julia Set sample, an OpenCL kernel is used to generate a Julia set image.
The main difference between this sample and the earlier sample is that in this sample the Julia set image is used as an OpenGL texture and rendered to the screen instead of writing it to a BMP file.

This sample can share the OpenGL texture with OpenCL when supported.
In order to share the OpenGL texture with OpenCL, the OpenCL device must support the [cl_khr_gl_sharing](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_Ext.html#cl_khr_gl_sharing) extension, and the OpenCL device must support sharing with the OpenGL context.
If sharing is not supported then the application will still run, but the Julia set image will be copied from OpenCL to OpenGL on the host.

Additionally, this sample can use implicit synchronization between OpenGL and OpenCL when supported.
Implicit synchronization requires support for the [cl_khr_gl_event](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_Ext.html#cl_khr_gl_event) extension.
If implicit synchronization is not supported then the application will still run, but synchronization will be done manually.

## Key APIs and Concepts

This example shows how to share an OpenGL texture with OpenCL.

```c
clGetGLContextInfoKHR
clCreateFromGLTexture2D
clEnqueueAcquireGLObjects
clEnqueueReleaseGLObjects
```

## Command Line Options

Note: Many of these command line arguments are identical to the earlier Julia set sample.

| Option | Default Value | Description |
|:--|:-:|:--|
| `-d <index>` | 0 | Specify the index of the OpenCL device in the platform to execute on the sample on.
| `-p <index>` | 0 | Specify the index of the OpenCL platform to execute the sample on.
| `-hostcopy` | n/a | Do not use the `cl_khr_gl_sharing` extension and unconditionally copy on the host.
| `-hostsync` | n/a | Do not use the `cl_khr_gl_event` extension and exclusively synchronize on the host.
| `-gwx <number>` | 512 | Specify the global work size to execute, in the X direction.  This also determines the width of the generated image.
| `-gwy <number>` | 512 | Specify the global work size to execute, in the Y direction.  This also determines the height of the generated image.
| `-lwx <number>` | 0 | Specify the local work size in the X direction.  If either local works size dimension is zero a `NULL` local work size is used.
| `-lwy <number>` | 0 | Specify the local work size in the Y direction.  If either local works size dimension is zero a `NULL` local work size is used.

## Controls While Running

| Control | Description |
|:--|:--|
| `Escape` | Exits from the sample.
| `Space` | Toggle animation (default: `false`).
| `V` | Toggle vsync (default: `true`). Disabling vsync may increase framerate but may cause [screen tearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing).
| `A` | Increase the real part of the complex constant `C`.
| `Z` | Decrease the real part of the complex constant `C`.
| `S` | Increase the imaginary part of the complex constant `C`.
| `X` | Decrease the imaginary part of the complex constant `C`.
