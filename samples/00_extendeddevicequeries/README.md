# extendeddevicequeries

## Sample Purpose

This is a simple sample that queries and prints extended device queries.
Currently, the queries added by the following extensions are supported:

* [cl_intel_device_attribute_query](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/extensions/intel/cl_intel_device_attribute_query.html)
* [cl_khr_device_uuid](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_Ext.html#cl_khr_device_uuid)
* [cl_khr_pci_bus_info](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/html/OpenCL_Ext.html#cl_khr_pci_bus_info)

There is also partial support for the extensions:

* [cl_amd_device_attribute_query](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/extensions/amd/cl_amd_device_attribute_query.txt)
* [cl_nv_device_attribute_query](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/extensions/nv/cl_nv_device_attribute_query.txt)

## Key APIs and Concepts

This sample demonstrates device attribute queries added by extensions.
